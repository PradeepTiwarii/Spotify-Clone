**Features:**

* User Interface inspired by Spotify
* Navigation bar with options like Home, Search, and Your Library
* Sections for displaying Recently Played, Trending Now, and Featured Charts
* Music player section with album artwork, song title, and playback controls

**Dependencies:**

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Deployment Options:**

* Host the files on a web server for online access.
